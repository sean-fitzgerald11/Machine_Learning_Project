      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Global warming and climate change have been topics of national and international discussion for decades. Countless research and 
        academic papers how quantified and solidified the effects that human activity is having on our climate, specifically the average temperature 
        of our planet. However, despite the urgency, it seems less and less likely that the necessary steps to avoid the worst outcomes are 
        likely to be taken in the time necessary. Thus, it is important to continue to work to understand as much as we can about our climate 
        and how it is changing. However, it is also becoming increasinly important to understand the implications that a changing climate will 
        have on our lived environment. This understanding includes the changes to severe weather events such as wilfires, droughts, hurricanes, 
        tornados. It also includes changes to experienced droughts or heavy rain events, the intensity of temperatures during different seasons, 
        especially summer and winter. All of these changes will most likely be materailly felt by all. Therefore, understanding the impacts that 
        can be expected can assists people in adapting to this changing climate and changing world.  
      </p>
      <p>In an effort to provide accurate and useful data in which to conduct historical climate analyses, NOAA generates and provides the Climate 
        Divisional Dataset. For many years this was the only available long-term temporally and spatially complete dataset (NCEI,NOAA,https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/monitoring/dyk/us-climate-divisions). 
        The breakdown of climate division for the contiguous United States can be seen below in Figure 1.
      </p>
      <img src="Images/us-climate-divisions.gif" alt="Figure 1. United States Climate Divisions">
      <p>The climate divisions above were determined based on identifying regions with similar climate conditions based on geographical features, vegeation, and 
        weather patterns. Below, in Figure 2, we can see a close up of the climate divisions within Colorado. We can observe that for Colorado, the most impactful 
        boundary between the divisions are the topological features of the state. Most of the division boundaries consist of mountainous or elevated terrain.
      </p>
      <img src="Images/Colorado Climate Divisions.png" alt="Figure 2. Colorado Climate Divisions">
      <p>It stands to reason that due to these differences in climate division, people living within Colorado stand to experience the effects of climate change differently
        depending on where they are located within the state. These differences might include changes in average maximum or minimum temperature or experience of drought or 
        rain events. Additionally, the the impacts of a changing climate could be felt in a change of the air quality that someone experiences. The Intergovernmental Panel 
        on Climate Change and the United States Environmental Protection Agency have both recognized the potential for climate change to impact the air quality that we 
        experience. 
      </p>
      <p>Ten questions that I would like to answer thorugh my research are:
      <ol>
        <li>Is there a significant difference in the trend of maximum and minimum temperature change over time between the different climate divsions?</li>
        <li>Is there a significant difference in the amount of precipitation experienced over time by each climate division?</li>
        <li>Is there a significant difference in the occurence and severity of drought experienced by each climate division?</li>
        <li>Is there a significant difference in the number of Heating Degree Days or Cooling Degree Days experienced by each climate division?</li>
        <li>Based on the differences in trends experienced, which climate division will has been most affected by climate change? Which one has been least affected?</li>
        <li>Is there a difference in air quality changes over time depending on the climate division being observed?</li>
        <li>Which climate division has experienced the greatest impact to their air quality? Is this most likely due to climate change or other factors?</li>
        <li>Which climate division has experienced the least impact to their air quality? Why might this be?</li>
        <li>Based on both climate trends and air quality trends, which climate division appears to be the most desirable to live in if climate trends continue?</li>
        <li>What additional research and investigation should be conducted in order to further this anlysis?</li>
      </ol>

         Sean was commissioned as an officer in the United States Army in May 2013. Since then, he has held numerous 
         leadership and staff positions from the tactical to organizational level. Sean spent 4 years as an Infantry 
         Officer and 7 years as a Military Intelligence Officer. In 2024, Sean reclassified as an Operations Research 
         and Systems Analysis Officer. As part of this transition, Sean has enrolled in the Master's of Data Science 
         program at University of Colorado, Boulder with an anticipated graduation date of May 2026.
